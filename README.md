# VBA-challenge

I tried to run my script on the larger file and it never worked. It worked fine on the smaller file but excel kept stopping when I tried to run it on the large file.

I used these websites to help me with this assignment:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.formatconditions.add
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/


I used several pages from the office help website.
